# Blitzscorer Android & iOS App Privary Policy

Both the Android and iOS Blitzscorer apps do not collect any personal data or display any ads.
We do not collect or use any personal information apart from what the Google Play Store and Apple App Store
provide by default to every app publisher.

While the Android app states that it requires access to the internet, this is a technical requirement of the
underlying library (Apache Cordova) so it can render html.
