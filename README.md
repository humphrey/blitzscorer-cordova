## Purpose of this app
The primary purpose I wrote this app is because I wanted to try and write a simple app that worked great on all platforms in Cordova.  And, a Dutch Blitz scoring app is something that I will use!  I was hoping to be able to use a single code base to publish to Android, iOS, OS X, Windows Desktop, and the web.  Firefox and Windows phones would be nice but not required.  I'm close, but [cordova-osx](https://github.com/apache/cordova-osx) doesn't appear to work.

## Get the app!
So far, the app has been published on a number of different stores.  Links to listings:

## Using this code
Go for it!  I'm not bothered what anybody uses this code for.  How do you use it?  Well, check out the Cordova Doc's.  The project is pretty stanard.
